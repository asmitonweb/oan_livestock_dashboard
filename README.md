# Livestock Registry Dashboard

Aggregate dashboard for the Livestock Registry: livestock keepers by region
(map with drill-down to kebele), species mix, herd health and registrations over
time. A standalone service, reached from the registry's staff portal as a tile
and open only to users with the **Dashboard Viewer** role.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for how access, data and IAM
registration work.

## Run

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local    # point it at a dashboard-api and an IAM
npm ci
npm run dev                   # http://localhost:3000
```

The dashboard needs:

- the registry's **dashboard-api** (`DASHBOARD_API_URL`), which serves the chart
  rows from the registry's reporting views;
- the registry's **IAM** (`IAM_URL`) for login and roles. For UI work without
  one, set `AUTH_ENABLED=false` (never in a deployment).

Container image:

```bash
docker build -t livestock-registry-dashboard .
docker run --env-file .env.local -p 3000:3000 livestock-registry-dashboard
```

Register the tile and role with IAM (idempotent), from the same image:

```bash
docker run --rm --env-file .env.local \
  -e IAM_REGISTER_URL=... -e TOKEN_URL=... -e DASHBOARD_CLIENT_SECRET=... \
  -e APP_DESCRIPTION="Livestock Dashboard" \
  livestock-registry-dashboard node iam/register.mjs
```

## Checks

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run build
```
